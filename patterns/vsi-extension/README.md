# Add a VSI to a landing zone VPC

![Architecture diagram for adding a VSI to your VPC landing zone deployable architecture](../../reference-architectures/vsi-extension.drawio.svg)

This architecture creates a VSI in some or all of the subnets of your existing landing zone VPC deployable architecture.

To deploy this architecture, you need the VPC ID, subnet names, and boot volume encryption key from your existing VPC landing zone deployable architecture. For information about finding the information, see [Adding a VSI to your VPC landing zone deployable architecture](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-draft/secure-infrastructure-vpc?topic=secure-infrastructure-vpc-ext-with-vsi).
