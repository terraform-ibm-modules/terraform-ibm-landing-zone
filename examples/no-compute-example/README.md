# VPC landing zone (No compute example)

![Architecture diagram for the Standard variation of VPC landing zone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-landing-zone/main/reference-architectures/vpc.drawio.svg)

You can use the VPC landing zone example to deploy a simple IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure without any compute resources like Virtual Server Instances (VSIs) or Red Hat OpenShift clusters.

The example is a modular solution because you can use this architecture as a base on which to deploy compute resources. You can also deploy those resources by using the other landing zone deployable architectures or Terraform modules.
