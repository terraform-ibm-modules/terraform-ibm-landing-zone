# VSI on VPC landing zone (Quick start example)

![vsi-quickstart](../../reference-architectures/vsi-quickstart.drawio.svg)

This example deploys the following infrastructure:

- An edge VPC with 1 VSI in one of the three subnets and a VPC load balancer in the edge VPC, exposing the VSI publicly.
- A jump server VSI in the management VPC, exposing a public floating IP address.

:exclamation: **Important:** This example helps you get started quickly, but is not highly available or validated for the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services.
