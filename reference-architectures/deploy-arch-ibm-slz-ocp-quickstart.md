# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on VPC landing zone - QuickStart variation
{: #roks-ra-qs}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-industry="Banking,FinancialSector"}
{: toc-use-case="Cybersecurity"}
{: toc-version="6.0.1"}

The QuickStart variation of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on VPC landing zone deployable architecture creates a fully customizable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment in a single region. The solution provides a single Red Hat OpenShift cluster in a secure VPC for your workloads. The QuickStart variation is designed to deploy quickly for demonstration and development.

## Requirements
{: #ra-roks-qs-requirements}

The following table outlines the requirements that are addressed in this architecture.

| Aspect | Requirements |
|---|---|
| Compute | Kubernetes cluster with minimal machine size and nodes, suitable for low-cost demonstration and development |
| Storage | Kubernetes cluster registry backup (required) |
| Networking | * Multiple VPCs for network isolation. \n * All public inbound and outbound traffic allowed to VPCs. \n * Administration of cluster allowed from public endpoint and web console. \n * Load balancer for cluster workload services. \n * Outbound internet access from cluster. \n * Private network connection between VPCs. |
| Security | * Encryption of all application data in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. \n * Storage and management of all encryption keys. \n * Protect cluster administration access through IBM Cloud security protocols. |
| Service Management | Automated deployment of infrastructure with IBM Cloud catalog |
