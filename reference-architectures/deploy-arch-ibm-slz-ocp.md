Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on VPC landing zone is a deployable architecture solution that is based on the IBM Cloud for Financial Services reference architecture. It creates secure and compliant Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform workload clusters on a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.

## Components
{: #ra-ocp-components}

### VPC architecture decisions
{: #ra-ocp-components-arch}

| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Provide access management and tooling for the workload that is deployed in the workload VPC | Management VPC service | Create a separate VPC service where SSH connectivity from outside is allowed | |
| Provide compute, storage, and network services to support hosted applications and operations that deliver services to the consumer | Workload VPC service | Create a separate VPC service as an isolated environment, without direct public internet connectivity and without direct SSH access | |
| * Demonstrate compliance with control requirements of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services  \n * Set up network for all created services  \n * Isolate network for all created services  \n * Ensure all created services are interconnected | Secure landing zone components | Create a minimum set of required components for a secure landing zone | Create a modified set of required components for a secure landing zone in preset |
{: caption="Table 1. Architecture decisions" caption-side="bottom"}

### Network security architecture decisions
{: #ra-ocp-components-arch-net-sec}

| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| * Isolate management VPC and allow only a limited number of network connections  \n * All other connections from or to management VPC are forbidden | ACL and security group rules in management VPC | | More ports might be opened in preset or added manually after deployment |
| * Isolate workload VPC and allow only a limited number of network connections  \n * All other connections from or to workload VPC are forbidden | ACL and security group rules in workload VPC | Open following ports by default: 53 (DNS service)  \n All ports to other VPCs are open | More ports might be opened in preset or added manually after deployment |
| Enable floating IP on bastion host to execute deployment | Floating IPs on bastion host in management VPC|Use floating IP on bastion host from IBM Schematics to complete deployment | |
| Load VPN configuration to simplify VPN setup | VPNs | VPN configuration is the responsibility of the customer | |
| Collect and store Internet Protocol (IP) traffic information with Activity Tracker and Flow Logs | Activity Tracker | | |
| Securely connect to multiple networks with a site-to-site virtual private network | | | |

## Compliance
{: #ra-ocp-compliance}

TODO: Decide whether to include a compliance section, and if so, add that information

_Optional section._ Feedback from users implies that architects want only the high-level compliance items and links off to control details that team members can review. Include the list of control profiles or compliance audits that this architecture meets. For controls, provide "learn more" links to the control library that is published in the IBM Cloud Docs. For audits, provide information about the compliance item.
