This deployable architecture pattern configures client-to-site VPN secure and encrypted server connectivity within an existing management VPC using only a few required inputs. After it's been deployed, you can install an OpenVPN client application on the devices that you wish to use for VPN access, and import a profile from the VPN server. The configuration also allows you to specify a list of users that can have access to the private network, with access control managed by IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management.

## Components
{: #ra-vpn-components}

### Client-to-site VPN architecture decisions
{: #ra-vpn-components-arch}

| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Set up secure client-to-site VPN | VPN | | |
| Store private certificate in existing Secrets Manager | Secrets Manager | Create and store private certificate to ensure secure communication and authentication between public network and the private VPC | |

### Network security architecture decisions
| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Load VPN configuration to simplify VPN setup | VPNs | Open following ports by default: 53 (DNS service), 443 (https) | |
| Create two subnets to achieve high availability | VPC | Distributing resources across two subnets allows for load balancing between them, ensuring that no single point of failure affects the performance or availability of client-to-site VPN | |
| * Create connection to isolated existing management VPC and allow only a limited number of network connections  \n * All other connections from or to existing management VPC are forbidden | ACL and security group rules in client-to-site VPN| | More ports might be opened in preset or added manually after deployment |
