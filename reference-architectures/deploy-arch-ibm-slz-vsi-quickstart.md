# VSI on VPC landing zone - QuickStart variation
{: #vsi-ra-qs}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-industry="Banking,FinancialSector"}
{: toc-use-case="Cybersecurity"}
{: toc-compliance="FedRAMP"}

The QuickStart variation of the VSI on VPC landing zone deployable architecture creates a fully customizable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment in a single region. The solution provides virtual servers in a secure VPC for your workloads. The QuickStart variation is designed to deploy quickly for demonstration and development.

## Components
{: #ra-vsi-qs-components}

### VPC architecture decisions
{: #ra-vsi-qs-components-arch}

| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| * Provide infrastructure administration access  \n * Limit the number of infrastructure administration entry points to ensure security audit | Management VPC service | Create a separate VPC service where SSH connectivity from outside is allowed | |
| * Provide infrastructure for service management components like backup, monitoring, IT service management, shared storage  \n * Ensure you can reach all IBM Cloud and on-premises services | Workload VPC service|Create a separate VPC service as an isolated environment, without direct public internet connectivity and without direct SSH access | |
| Create a virtual server instance to run your workload | Proxy server VPC instance | Create a VPC instance that can act as a proxy server. Configure ACL and security group rules to allow public internet traffic over proxy that uses default proxy ports (3828) | Configure application load balancer to act as proxy server manually |
| Create a virtual server instance as the only management access point to the landscape | Bastion host VPC instance | Create a Linux VPC instance that acts as a bastion host. Configure ACL and security group rules to allow SSH connectivity (port 22). Add a public IP address to the VPC instance. Allow connectivity from a restricted and limited number of public IP addresses. Allow connectivity from IP addresses of the Schematics engine nodes | |
| * Set up network for all created services  \n * Isolate network for all created services  \n * Ensure all created services are interconnected | Secure landing zone components | Create a minimum set of required components for a secure landing zone | Create a modified set of required components for a secure landing zone in preset |

### Network security architecture decisions
{: #ra-vsi-qs-components-arch-net-sec}

| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| * Isolate management VPC and allow only a limited number of network connections  \n * All other connections from or to management VPC are forbidden | ACL and security group rules in management VPC|Open following ports by default: 22 (for limited number of IPs)  \n All ports to other VPCs are open |More ports might be opened in preset or added manually after deployment |
| * Isolate workload VPC and allow only a limited number of network connections  \n * All other connections from or to workload VPC are forbidden | ACL and security group rules in workload VPC | Open following ports by default: 53 (DNS service)  \n All ports to other VPCs are open | More ports might be opened in preset or added manually after deployment |
| Enable floating IP on bastion host to execute deployment | Floating IPs on bastion host in management VPC|Use floating IP on bastion host from IBM Schematics to complete deployment | |
| Load VPN configuration to simplify VPN setup | VPNs | VPN configuration is the responsibility of the customer | |
{: caption="Table 2. Network security architecture decisions" caption-side="bottom"}

### Key and password management architecture decisions
{: #ra-vsi-qs-components-arch-key-pw}

| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| * Use public and private SSH keys to access virtual server instances by using SSH  \n * Use SSH proxy to log in to all virtual server instances by using the bastion host  \n * Do not store private SSH key on any virtual instances, also not on the bastion host  \n * Do not allow any other SSH login methods except the one with the specified public and private SSH key pair | Public and private SSH keys provided by customer | Ask customer to specify the keys. Accept the input as secure parameter or as reference to the key stored in IBM Cloud Secure Storage Manager. Do not print SSH keys in any log files. Do not persist private SSH key. | |

## Compliance
{: #ra-vsi-qs-compliance}

TODO: Decide whether to include a compliance section, and if so, add that information

_Optional section._ Feedback from users implies that architects want only the high-level compliance items and links off to control details that team members can review. Include the list of control profiles or compliance audits that this architecture meets. For controls, provide "learn more" links to the control library that is published in the IBM Cloud Docs. For audits, provide information about the compliance item.
 -->

<!--
## Next steps
{: #ra-vsi-qs-next-steps}

TODO: Decide what next steps to list, if any

Optional section. Include links to your deployment guide or next steps to get started with the architecture. -->
