{: #vsi-ra-qs}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-industry="Banking,FinancialSector"}
{: toc-use-case="Cybersecurity"}
{: toc-version="5.29.0"}

The QuickStart variation of the VSI on VPC landing zone deployable architecture creates a fully customizable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment in a single region. The solution provides virtual servers in a secure VPC for your workloads. The QuickStart variation is designed to deploy quickly for demonstration and development.

## Components

### VPC architecture decisions
{: #ra-vsi-qs-components-arch}

| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| * Provide infrastructure/application administration access to monitor, operate, and maintain the environment.  \n * Limit the number of infrastructure/application administration entry points to ensure security audit. | Management VPC service | Create a separate VPC service where SSH connectivity from outside is allowed | |
| * Provides compute, storage, and network services to support hosted applications and operations that deliver services to the consumer.  \n * Ensure you can reach IBM Cloud services, Workload VPC and Management VPC | Workload VPC service|Create a separate VPC service as an isolated environment, without direct public internet connectivity and without direct SSH access | |
| Create a virtual server instance to support hosted applications | Workload virtual server instance | Create a VPC virtual server instance that can act as a workload server to support hosted applications. Configure ACL and security group rules allow access to IBM Cloud services, Workload and Management VPC's | |
| Create a virtual server instance as the only management access point to the environment | Jump box host VPC instance | Create a Linux VPC instance that acts as a jump box host. Configure ACL and security group rules to allow SSH connectivity (port 22). Add a public IP address to the VPC instance. | |
| * Set up network for all created services  \n * Isolate network for all created services  \n * Ensure all created services are interconnected | Secure landing zone components | Create a minimum set of required components for a secure landing zone | Create a modified set of required components for a secure landing zone in preset |

### Network security architecture decisions
{: #ra-vsi-qs-components-arch-net-sec}

| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| * Isolate management VPC and allow SSH network connections from public network  \n * All other connections from or to management VPC are forbidden except for IBM services and VPC | ACL and security group rules in management VPC|Open following ports by default: 22 (for limited number of IPs)  \n All ports to other VPCs are open |More ports might be opened in preset or added manually after deployment |
| * Isolate workload VPC and allow only a limited number of network connections  \n * All other connections from or to workload VPC are forbidden | ACL and security group rules in workload VPC | Allow connectivity for IBM Cloud services, Workload VPC and Management VPC | More ports might be opened in preset or added manually after deployment |
| Enable floating IP on jump box host | Floating IPs on jump box host in management VPC|Use floating IP on jump box host for administration access | |

### Key and password management architecture decisions
{: #ra-vsi-qs-components-arch-key-pw}

| Requirement | Component | Reasons for choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| * Use public SSH key to access virtual server instances by using SSH | Public SSH key provided by customer | Ask customer to specify the key. Accept the input as secure parameter. | |
